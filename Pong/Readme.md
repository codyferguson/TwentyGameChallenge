# Game #1
Choose to make Pong or Flappy Bird. I chose to go with Pong because it seemed easier to get to a final product with what I know. 
This could evolve into it's own game of Ye Ole Pong where everything looks like it is from the Middle Ages.

## Postmortem
This took way longer than I had hoped. The main concept was done fairly early but I had to refer to a tutorial unfortunately. Next time, only use the docs and google to struggle through making this work.

Pretty straight forward project and it was fun to do. For an enhancement project, I would really like to build out power ups and some other features to practice adding to an existing game design.
