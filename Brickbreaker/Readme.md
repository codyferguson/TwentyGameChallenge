# Game #1

Choose to make Pong or Flappy Bird. I chose to go with Pong because it seemed easier to get to a final product with what I know. 
This could evolve into it's own game of Ye Ole Pong where everything looks like it is from the Middle Ages.

## Tasks

[x] Create a game space with walls and a ceiling.
[x] Add a paddle that can be moved left and right via player inputs
[x] Add a ball that will bounce off of the paddle, walls, and ceiling.
[x] Add square game objects (bricks) into the top of the game space.
[x] Enable the ball to bounce off of the bricks. When the ball bounces, the brick should disappear.
[x] Breaking a brick should add to the player’s score.
[] The ball’s speed should increase as bricks are broken. (Interesting. I increase with each hit off surface)
[x] The score should be displayed.
[x] Life counter. The player starts with three lives. If the player misses the ball, a life should be subtracted
[] A way to exit play to main menu or exit program

### Added

[] Add gravity (or somthing) to ball so it doesn't get stuck
