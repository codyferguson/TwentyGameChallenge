# Game #2

Choose to make Breakout or Jetpack Joyride. I went with Breakout as I have tried to make this game before and I felt like it was a good project right after pong to build on those skills. 

## Tasks

[x] Create a game space with walls and a ceiling.
[x] Add a paddle that can be moved left and right via player inputs
[x] Add a ball that will bounce off of the paddle, walls, and ceiling.
[x] Add square game objects (bricks) into the top of the game space.
[x] Enable the ball to bounce off of the bricks. When the ball bounces, the brick should disappear.
[x] Breaking a brick should add to the player’s score.
[] The ball’s speed should increase as bricks are broken. (Interesting. I increase with each hit off surface) CHANGE TO THIS
[x] The score should be displayed.
[x] Life counter. The player starts with three lives. If the player misses the ball, a life should be subtracted
[x] Main menu
[x] Win / Game over splash screen
[x] A way to exit play to main menu or exit program
[] Clear level ends game
[] Add ball bouncy sound on all surfaces
[] Menu click noises

### Added

[] Add gravity (or somthing) to ball so it doesn't get stuck -- gravity acts funny even at 0.1

## Postmortem

This game is not very fun to work on but I have to balance what I can achieve with what I want to make. Just grabbing some code did speed up the ball reflect on the paddle which was nice. It's nice to have these small, bite sized games to complete but man do they get boring to work on when they are this simple. I need to find a happy medium to keep the motivation to work on these. Maybe just move on to those bigger games that are more fun to make.
